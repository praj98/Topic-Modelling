# Topic Modeling Project

## Introduction
This project involves the application of topic modeling techniques to an email dataset to uncover key themes and topics. The primary method used for topic modeling in this report is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Directory containing the email dataset.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, modeling, and analysis.
- **models/**: Directory to save trained models.
- **reports/**: Directory for generated reports and visualizations.
- **src/**: Source code for data processing and modeling.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Approach
The overall approach consisted of the following steps:

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Loading Data**: The email data was loaded from an Excel file.
2. **Text Cleaning**: The email subjects were cleaned by removing stop words, punctuation, and non-alphabetic characters. Lemmatization was applied using spaCy to convert words to their base forms.
3. **Tokenization**: The cleaned subjects were split into lists of words (tokens).

### Bag-of-Words Representation
- A dictionary was created from the tokenized subjects.
- Each document was converted into a bag-of-words (BoW) representation.

### Topic Modeling with LDA
- An LDA model was trained on the corpus with a predefined number of topics (10 in this case).
- Parameters for the LDA model were fine-tuned to improve coherence and interpretability of the topics.

### Topic Interpretation and Labeling
- The top words for each topic were extracted and manually reviewed.
- Based on the top words, each topic was assigned a descriptive label to reflect the underlying theme.

## Techniques Used
- **Lemmatization**: Using spaCy, words were reduced to their base forms, standardizing the text and reducing dimensionality.
- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: This probabilistic model was used to discover topics within the text, assuming that documents are mixtures of topics and that topics are mixtures of words.
- **Manual Topic Labeling**: After extracting the top words for each topic, a human-readable label was assigned based on the most frequent and relevant words.

## Why LDA?
1. **Proven Effectiveness**: LDA is a well-established method known for its ability to identify coherent and interpretable topics.
2. **Probabilistic Approach**: LDA uses a probabilistic approach, providing a richer understanding of the data compared to hard clustering methods.
3. **Flexibility**: LDA handles different dataset sizes effectively and adapts to various types of textual data.
4. **Interpretability**: The topics generated by LDA are generally interpretable, making it easier to label and understand the underlying themes.
5. **Implementation and Tuning**: LDA is straightforward to implement using libraries like Gensim, with several tunable parameters for optimization.

## Conclusion
The LDA model effectively identified distinct topics within the email dataset. Each topic was characterized by its top words, and descriptive labels were assigned to provide a clear understanding of the themes. This topic modeling approach is valuable for categorizing and summarizing large collections of text data, aiding in better information retrieval and data analysis.
